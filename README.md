# page-rank
An algorithm which classifies the nodes of a graph by assigning an importance score to each of these nodes

To launch this program, just open your terminal in the current directory and type:
python3 main.py

**Input** : An adjacency matrix A of a directed, weighted and regular graph G thus
that a teleportation parameter Â® between 0 and 1 (0.7 by default and for the results
to present).

**Output** : A vector x containing the scores

This project contains:
* ``Graphe7.png`` : An image representing the graph and the nodes
* ``graphAndMatrix.png`` : An image with the matrix derived from the graph
* ``main.py``  : The executable file with the main function
* ``myGraph.csv`` : a csv file containing the adjacency matrix A of the graph provided ( each value is separated by a comma and each row of the matrix with a newline)
* ``README.md``
